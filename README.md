Title: Ingredient-based Recipe Generator

Description: It is a common problem to figure out what is for dinner when looking at a refrigerator and pantry full of ingredients, but lack guidance on what to do with them. Through the recipe generator, a user can receive up to ten recipes based on ingredients they have on hand or wish to cook with. Recipe links will be provided along with lists of missing ingredients. 

How to use the app:
•	You will be greeted and prompted to input ingredients
•	Enter ingredients separated by commas
o	Be sure to specify if ingredients are diet-specific (ex. Gluten-free flour, vegan butter)
o	Diet-specific ingredients will produce compliant recipes
•	A recipe will be pulled via the API and you will be given a recipe title, link to the webpage, and remaining ingredients needed 
•	You will be asked if you want to receive another recipe. Type in “y” for yes and “n” for no.
•	If you replied “y”, you’ll receive another recipe as well as the same option to see an additional recipe.
•	If you replied “n”, the app will close and you can get cooking.
